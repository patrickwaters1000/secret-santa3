Trying to build and deploy

1. Building and running a jar

Use `lein uberjar` to build a jar.
Wanted to choose the jar name.
Set :project :uberjar :jar-name in project.clj.
But it builds two jars, and the one with the custom name doesn't work.
Someone explained on stack overflow that it doesn't contain Clojure.
OK, so we won't set the jar name.

Use `java -jar target/uberjar/secret-santa3-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`
to run the jar.
Made this part of the dev.sh script
It wasn't loading the javascript.
Well, core.clj is using relative paths to locate the front end code, so I'm
surprised it works at all.
Updated the dev script to move the built javascript to back/resources.
Moved index.html to back/resources.
Updated core.clj to use io/resource instead of relative paths.
Seems to be working now.

2. Provisioning an AWS EC2 instance

Password in 1Password was out of date.
Tried to reset it, but couldn't pass the captcha thing.
Clicked a button for an audio captcha instead, which was easier.
After resetting the password they wanted me to pass a captcha just to log in.
That momentarilly confused me, and I was refreshing my tab to make it go away.
But actually I just had to do the captcha.
Updated 1Password.

Logging in took me to AWS Marketplace
(https://aws.amazon.com/mp/marketplace-service/overview/)
which did not have any obvious button for EC2.
Ah, but there is a "sign in to the console" button in the upper right part of
the screen; clicked that.
Clicked EC2.
Clicked "launch instance"
Clicked "my AMIs"
Surprisingly there is "Secret Santa3 Server" saved
In the "key pair", "secret-santa-key-pair" was not clearly visible but appeared
when I searched for it.
"Create security group" is selected.
Clicked boxes to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic
Clicked "launch instance".
Got to a screen with several rectangular buttons.
Clicked a rectangular button "connect to instance".
Got to a page with 4 tabs for different ways to connect.
In the "ssh client" tab, there is a shell command
ssh -i "secret-santa-key-pair.pem" root@ec2-3-137-186-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
but it doesn't work.
Had to change "root" to "ubuntu", then it worked.

3. Deploying and running the server.

Started running commands from deploy.sh, e.g., `sudo apt update`.
Got a weird full screen dialog box when running `sudo apt upgrade -y`.
It wanted to know what services to restart.
I had no idea what it was talking about, but pressed enter a few times and it went away.
Copied the jar onto the server.
Tried to run the jar.
It printed "Ready!" to the terminal, but then crashed with
"Exception in thread "main" java.net.SocketException: Permission denied"
I think the operating system is not allowing the server to connect to a port or something.
Oops, you have to run the command with sudo.
Good thing I had Lindsay here to help with that.
Run the server with
sudo java -jar app.jar \
     -n Allen \
     -n Ben \
     -n Bonnie \
     -n Carley \
     -n Essie \
     -n Patrick \
     -n Tom \
     -g 2 \
     -i Tom,Bonnie \
     -i Allen,Essie \
     -i Ben,Carley

4. Connecting to the server

Point your browser to
http://ec2-3-137-186-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:443

5. Shut down the server

Or else Amazon will take your $$.
